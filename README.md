„Prediction-error neurons in circuits with multiple neuron types: Formation, refinement, and functional implications“

This repository provides the source code to **qualitatively** reproduce the main publication figures, that is, creating, running, analysing and plotting the network model with excitatory cells and three types of inhibitory interneurons. 

To reproduce the main figures, please run the corresponding python code (Run_\*.py) with the parameters specified within the script. After the script has been run successfully, it will save the data (Results/Data/\*) and the figure (Results/Figures/\*). Note that the results may vary slightly because of different initialisations and random numbers used in simulations.

Remark: Supplementary figures can be reproduced using the same code. In case of questions, problems or requests, feel free to contact the authors.
